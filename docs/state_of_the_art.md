## TOPIC: The issue (and need) of sustainable development of mountain huts

📝  Provincia Autonoma di Trento. (2021). Strategia Provinciale per lo Sviluppo Sostenibile. Retrieved from https://agenda2030.provincia.tn.it/content/download/8216/151887/file/Delibera%20G.P.%20n.%201721%20-%2015%20ottobre%202021.pdf

💡 Strategy adopted by the Autonomous Province of Trento to align with the National Strategy for Sustainable Development and ultimately with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) of ONU’s Agenda 2030. 

🆒 Several points about the __need and willingness to make alpine environments and tourism more sustainable__. Main points:
    Objective - Sustainable tourism (p. 64) 
  Two main indicators:
  • Presenze in esercizi ricettivi open air, agriturismi e rifugi montani sul totale delle presenze in esercizi ricettivi 
  • Tasso di turisticità
  Entro 2030:
  23.Sostenere l’adozione dei progetti di monitoraggio e potabilizzazione in loco dell’acqua superficiale in tutte le strutture in alta quota, in alternativa al trasporto e vendita di acqua in bottiglia (tramite il progetto avviato nel 2020 da Associazione Gestori Rifugi del Trentino, SAT e U.O. di Igiene e Sanità Pubblica dell’APSS).
  31.Monitorare l’incremento di frequentazione di determinate aree ancora caratterizzate da una certa wilderness (es. Lagorai) e studiare delle strategie per tutelare gli ambienti più incontaminati (miglioramento della segnaletica, regolamentazione del campeggio, informativa presso rifugi e bivacchi per sensibilizzare al rispetto dell’ambiente e delle strutture).
  
  Objective - Water (p. 72): water distribution efficiency
  Entro 2030:
  7. Promuovere gli usi plurimi di laghi e fiumi in una visione integrata, attraverso “servizi d’uso territoriali” che includano anche gli usi turistici.
  15. Introdurre nelle norme edilizie linee guida di gestione territoriale e urbanistica sul rallentamento delle acque piovane (aumento dei tempi di corrivazione) e loro filtraggio (es. con superfici drenanti, con disoleatori per le condutture di acque bianche), o con un loro nuovo utilizzo (es. irriguo verde urbano).
  19. Proseguire con la ricerca ed il monitoraggio dei corpi glaciali attraverso la collaborazione attiva dei soggetti competenti che già oggi la conducono (PAT, Comitato glaciologico SAT, Parchi, Musei...), anche istituendo centri studi dedicati, e favorire la diffusione delle informazioni e dei dati raccolti.
  
  Objective - Emission Reduction (p. 82)
  Entro 2030:
  13.Promuovere l’elettrificazione ad alta efficienza di utenze isolate (es. rifugi), comunitá e sistemi distribuiti remoti ad elevato impatto ambientale (come ad esempio gli impianti di risalita delle stazioni sciistiche) tramite micro-reti alimentate esclusivamente o prevalentemente con fonti rinnovabili eventualmente supportate da sistemi di accumulo.
  
  Objective: Sustainable Mobility (p. 92)

💡 Survey with 51 responses over 74 mountain huts in Trentino aimed at analyzing the needs and challenges of managing mountain huts.

🆒 Main challenges are about water sourcing and electricity. More than 50% of huts declared to have issues with seasonal water scarcity. There is no unique formula for managing the resources of a hut: some rely on a single option (e.g. only solar panels or single water source), others have a combination. This depends on the local context and possibilities of the structure. Managers of huts would invest in more resilient and sustainable alternatives. 
Also useful for creating the indicator!

💡 The first joint congress of the “Trails and Cartography” (SOSEC) and “Mountain Huts and Alpine Works” (SOROA) functional units, held in Trento on 14 and 15 January 2023, confirmed the commitment of the CAI to the future of alpine mountain huts, in light of the climate crisis and the changes taking place in mountain tourism.  The ideas that emerged at the national level, particularly on the issues of sustainability and water resource management.

## TOPIC: Eco-tourism
📝 Nepal, S. K. (2002). Mountain Ecotourism and Sustainable Development: Ecology, Economics, and Ethics. Mountain Research and Development, 22(2), 104–109.

💡 Definition of eco-tourism and overview of the trends in mountain ecotourism in developed and developing countries. 

🆒 Environmental impacts of tourism and need for criteria and indicators.


## TOPIC: Measuring Sustainability

📝 Stubelj Ars, M., & Bohanec, M. (2010). Towards the ecotourism: A decision support model for the assessment of sustainability of mountain huts in the Alps. Journal of Environmental Management, 91(12), 2554–2564. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2010.07.006

💡 Proposes a Decision Support Model for assessing the sustainability and ecotourism state of mountain huts in the Slovenian Alps. Decision Support Systems (DSSs) are interactive computer-based systems intended to help decision makers utilize data and models to identify and solve problems and make decisions. This paper proposes a **qualitative multi-attribute model** that characterizes the sustainability of a hut on various aspects (energy, accessibility, etc.) by using hierarchically structured attributes. DSS is implemented on the Dexi software for 4 chosen mountain huts.

🆒 The attributes used seem like a complete and feasible way to assess the level of sustainability. Their approach is purely qualitative, perhaps inspiration can be taken for a defining a quantitative indicator.

📝 Mila Gandino. (2014). Il contributo dell’analisi multicriteri spaziale nella gestione sostenibile della rete di rifugi del CAI: il caso della provincia di Sondrio. Politecnico di Milano.

💡 Master thesis developed a Multicriteria Spatial Decision Support System (MC-SDSS) for the Sondrio province, in order to find out the best criteria to allocate the funds. Considered both aspects related to the territory, evaluating the different areas on a cultural, touristic and environmental basis, and aspects related to every specific structure, regarding for example the conservation and the different environmental systems used. 

🆒  From page 120 (Section 7.4.1) territorial analysis via creating several maps to assess different criterias for the territory’s potential, from touristic/accessibility and landscape value point of view.

💡 Research project (ANAH) about sustainability of mountain huts. 

🆒 In order to examine the sustainability of the "hut" system, three areas of investigation (building, ongoing operations, guests) were examined in more detail within the three pillars of sustainability (ecological, social, economic). This results in a total of 16 goals and 22 indicators that describe sustainability.

💡 Compares three different procedures for weighting sustainability indicators in the construction of composite indicators of tourism sustainability (TS). The three procedures are Factor Analysis, Expert Opinion and equal weights. Findings suggests the more appropriate technique depends on the degree of correlations between the individual indicators (reflective vs formative conceptualization).

🆒 Understand if the individual indicators I will use fall in the reflective or formative scenario.

📝 Mazziotta, M., & Pareto, A. (2013). METHODS FOR CONSTRUCTING COMPOSITE INDICES: ONE FOR ALL OR ALL FOR ONE? Rivista Italiana Di Economia Demografia e Statistica, (2).

💡 Explains the challenges and methods for creating a composite indicator.

🆒 My indicator will be a composite indicator consisting of several individual indicators for the different facets of sustainability (e.g. “water” will then have different indicators such as distance from water source, number of water sources, water consumption, etc). Each individual indicator is assigned a weight based on a chosen method. Individual indicators should also be normalized. Overall good framework.

💡 Composite indicator system from the European Commission for tourist destination. 4 facets of sustainability: (1) destination management (2) social and cultural impact (3) economic value (4) environmental impact. 

🆒 Some indicators from the tables starting at page 21 can be adapted to my context. But overall this indicator is more for cities / regions instead of huts which can be considered as destinations, but practices are different.

## TOPIC: related research (sustainable toursim in alpine/natural areas)

💡 Investigates opinions about sustainable tourism developement and monitoring with interviews with individuals working in this field.

🆒 Developing significant indicators is difficult due to the diversity of contexts and priorities. Suggest that a holistic approach and collection and dissemination of data and knowledge on sustainability are the basis for developing sustainable mountain tourism.
