| Area | Issue | Measure | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **WATER** (goal: reliability \-\> water is enough and well used) | **provision**: water sources  | **number of water source(s)**  |  |
|  |  | **type of water source(s)**: water well (pozzo), open water source (lake, stream, underground water), glacier/snow field (nevaio), rainwater tank, conduit pipe. |  |
|  | **consumption** | **water consumption per day** \[m^3\] |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| **ELECTRICITY & HEATING** (goal: reliability \+ sustainability \-\> enough resources, better if env sustainable) | **provision** | **number of power source(s)** |  |
|  |  | **type of power sources:** photovoltaic, generator, hydro-electric turbine, electric wires (rete elettrica), wood, gas cylinder (bombola) | assign weights based on env sustainability ? Favour renewables. |
|  | **consumption** | **total power consumption per day** \[kW\]  |  |
|  |  | (only for \>1 sources) **percentage** of consumption per day **for each source** |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| **SUPPLIES** | **provision** | **mode of hut supplying**: foot, horse power, helicopter, cable railway (teleferica), car/van |  |
|  |  | **number of trips** | balance between modality and number of trips? |
| **WASTE** | **solid waste management** | **in-loco organic waste disposal:** compost, animals, waste disposer (tritarifiuti), no. | favour in-loco? |
|  |  | **mode of transport to valley**: same alternatives as mode of hut supplying. |  |
|  |  | **number of trips** | balance between modality and number of trips? |
|  |  | **separate waste (raccolta diff):** yes/no |  |
|  | **waste waters management** | **in-loco treatment**: yes/no |  |
|  |  | (if yes): mode of treatment \+ way of transport of residual waste to valley |  |
| **AFFLUENCE** (goal: appropriate affluence for capacity and connectivity) | **accessibility** | **main accesses**: hiking trails, roads, cable car |  |
|  |  | **number of accesses** (number of trails, roads etc.) |  |
|  | **capacity** (number of people)  | overnight capacity day capacity   |  |
|  | **affluence** | ratio between registered affluence (daily / weekly?) and actual capacity |  |
|  |  | average length of stay of tourists (nights)  |  |

→ How to assign weights to each sub-indicator? Can compare 3 methods:

- equal weights  
- expert’s opinion based on the conclusions of 2022 survey (*“esigenze dei rifugi alpini in trentino..”*)  
- Factor Analysis

Which are the 3 methods compared in Kozic, I., & Mikulic, J. (2014).
