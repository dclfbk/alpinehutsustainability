This repository serves as the comprehensive archive for the thesis project titled "Assessing the Sustainability of Mountain Huts Using Spatially Driven Multi-Criteria Decision-Making Methods". It contains all the essential elements required to understand, replicate, and build upon the work presented in the thesis.
### Repository Structure
- code: The scripts and computational models developed for data analysis, application of Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) methods, and visualization of results.
- data: Datasets used throughout the research, including raw data collected from various sources, pre-processed data, and outputs generated during the analysis.
- document: Detailed explanations of the methodology, including step-by-step instructions to apply MCDM methods, criteria and weight selection processes, and clustering analyses. It also contains theoretical background information and relevant references.
- results: Generated outputs such as sustainability rankings, maps, and clustering diagrams that illustrate the findings of the study.

### Objectives of the Repository
- To provide transparency in the research process by making the code, data, and documentation accessible.
- To enable replication of the analysis and encourage further research in sustainability assessments, particularly in the context of mountain huts.
- To contribute to the academic and practical understanding of sustainable tourism and the integration of spatially driven methods in decision-making processes.

### Usage
This repository is intended for researchers, decision-makers, and practitioners in the fields of sustainable tourism, environmental management, and alpine resource planning. By following the documentation provided, users can adapt the methodologies for similar sustainability assessments in different contexts.
